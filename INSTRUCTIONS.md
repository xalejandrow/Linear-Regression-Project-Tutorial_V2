Predicting the medical insurance cost of a person

This dataset has 7 columns. We will use the 'charges' column as the target variable because we want to create a model that predicts the cost of the insurance based on different factors.

Columns

    age: age of primary beneficiary

    sex: insurance contractor gender, female or male

    bmi: Body mass index

    children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents

    smoker: Smoking

    region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.

    charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

Step 1:

The dataset can be found in this project folder as 'medical_insurance_cost.csv' file. You are welcome to load it directly from the link (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4GeeksAcademy/linear-regression-project-tutorial/main/medical_insurance_cost.csv), or to download it and add it to your data/raw folder. In that case, don't forget to add the data folder to the .gitignore file.

    If you find yourself struggling with this project, you can check out the solution guide: https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/linear-regression-project-tutorial/blob/main/solution_guide.ipynb

Time to work on it!

Step 2:

Use the explore.ipynb notebook to find patterns and valuable information about relationships between features or between feature and target.

    Hint: There are no null values

Don't forget to write your observations.

Step 3:

Now that you have a better knowledge of the data, in your exploratory notebook create a first linear regression model with your data, in order to predict the insurance prima.

Choose a metric to measure your results.

Step 4:

Hypertune your model to improve your results.

Use the app.py to create your final machine learning modeling pipeline.

Save your final model in the 'models' folder.

In your README file write a brief summary.
